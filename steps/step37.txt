Now : lets push the code ot github, but lets push in branches now using PULL and PUSH request, thus here below.

So : we know that we have a master branch by default ; in the same branch we have first the initial commit, then next commit and so on .... on the same branch ; but now later in future if we won't like that feature, then if we don't like to implement the feature ; i.e. if we just want to experiment something, then we will just create a test branch for this from the master production branch with those extra features and delete the changes later by deleting that branch completely from there ; so we get rid of all the changes and the app's main production branch will still be working ; but if we liked that branch later and now want to merge it in the master branch, then we can send a PULL request to the master branch from that branch, and then the main person of the app will review the code and if he is satisfied, he will MERGE THE PULL REQUEST and then we will be able to have the latest changes in the master branch in production as well there ; so instead of adding the changes to the master branch directly, we instead make changes in a seperate branch, and later if like it, MERGES it to the master branch there, thus here below.

So : its a better convention to do all experiments in a seperate branch, and later if happy with it and it works, then we send a PULL REQUEST to the master branch and then MERGE IT , if we like it ; now here in this project we are alone doing everything, so we will be doing both PULL request and MERGE by ourselves only here ; but in a company , the TEAM LEAD will review the code and then MERGE IT only if they like it , else they can reject it by adding some comments on it like making it more better and modular i.e. breaking into a more reusable components and simplifying it more, thus here below.

So : we will create a new branch for every feature we add -> send a PULL request to master branch -> MERGE that pull request, thus here below.

So: how to do that, see the next steps in step38.txt file now there.
