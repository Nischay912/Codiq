Error comes for "vite" not found and also : "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.3" NOT FOUND as in frontend/package.json we have -

"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^7.1.7",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.3"
}

so render not installs develeopment devDependencies ; so push it to -

"dependencies": {
  "react": "^19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "^19.1.1",
  "vite": "^7.1.7",
  "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^5.0.3"
}

; AND NEVER THINK LIKE OK I ADDED IT TO dependencies TOO, BUT ITS STILL IN devDependencies ALSO , NOO : NEVER KEEP SAME PACKAGES IN BOTH OF THEM, IT WILL NOT WORK AS EXPECTED THERE, THUS HERE BELOW.

and commit the changes, thus here below.

It automatically re-deploys there, thus here below.
