Error comes for "vite" not found as in frontend/package.json we have -

"devDependencies": {
  "vite": "^7.1.7"
}

so render not installs develeopment devDependencies ; so push it to -

"dependencies": {
  "react": "^19.1.1",
  "react-dom": "^19.1.1",
  "vite": "^7.1.7"
}

and commit the changes, thus here below.
