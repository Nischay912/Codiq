But now we are storing the user in the Clerk's database, but we want the user to be stored in MongoDB database as well ; so here we will use INGEST ; clerk will send an event or lets say "web hook" to INNGEST, such as "user.created" and then INNGEST will allow us to run a background job there which is a function that will help to take the user and save it to the MongoDB database , and that function will be like connectToMongoDB and will do user.save with the user's information, thus here below.

Also now here we will be using STREAM to provide video calling, chat messages, etc ; and so we also want to save this user of Clerk to STREAM, thus here below ; also if user is deleted from Clerk we will also delete him from MongoDB and STREAM using the user.delete coming from Clerk's webhook, thus here below.

Now : lets go on inngest.com > sign in using github > put the name as codiq > create ; then we click on the KEY icon in left sidebar > event keys > copy and put in .env of backend as we will be using inngest for background jobs in backend on not on the client side ; similarly click KEY icon and get the signing key from there as well, thus here below.

Then we go on : getstream.io > signin > dashboard > create app > app name > keep environment as development and create > click on any of chats or video, all have same keys and all > click API KEYS > get the key and secret and place in .env file of backend, thus here below.

Then put the env variable of clerk Publishable key in .env of backend as well to use it later for authentication of the user as well there, thus here below ; but its not frontend, so from VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY ; delete the "VITE" part and then keep in env of backend, thus here below.

Then go on clerk.com > docs > express > scroll and get both key and secret and put in .env of backend, thus here below.

Delete the assets folder from frontend as no use of us, thus here below.

See the next steps in step62.txt file now there.
