Now we will be creating our express app in the server.js file > now normally to do so : we do -

const express = require('expresss'); 

This is called the commonJs syntax ; but we want to use a modern syntax i.e. -

import express from "express"

To use this > we go under "package.json" > then there add the following -

"type" : "module",

So, now we can use import/export in the files everywhere now there, thus here below.

See the next steps now in server.js file now there, thus here below.
