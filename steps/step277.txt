Now : lets setup TanStack in main.jsx file > go to main.jsx > and set it up there.

Go to tanstack.com > choose QUERY from left sidebar as we will implement react query fetch/refetch and all talked about in step276.txt file earlier there now, thus here below.

So now : click on DOCS > in terminal do > cd frontend > "npm i @tanstack/react-query@5.90.5" > then go in "main.jsx" file and then > get the imports as mentioned in the docs > then as per the DOCS wrap the entire application with <QueryClientProvider client = {queryClient}> component there ; where : const queryClient = new QueryClient(), so do all this in main.jsx file there, thus here below.

So: after this we can use the "useQuery" and every other thing coming from tanstack anywhere now in our application, thus here below.

See the next steps in step278.txt file now there, thus here below.
