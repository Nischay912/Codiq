Now : to design the code-editor part > we will use a package called "monaco editor in react", thus here below.

So : its the same editor format that VS code also actually uses there ; as on its docs its written also that : "The monaco-editor is a well-known web technology based code editor that powers VS Code", and so we will use this same editor on our website on the browser too there, thus here below.

So go on : https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react > and do now : cd terminal > "npm i @monaco-editor/react@4.7.0"

Now : see the next steps in ProblemPage.jsx file now there, thus here below.
