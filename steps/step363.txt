now: lets have a folder "data" with problems in it as objects i.e. we will have there > an object called PROBLEMS and inside the object, we have problem-names and its description object as key-value pairs.

So: for each problem there, we have > id, title, and all there got from AI of leetcode, thus here below.

And, we also have the starter code for the different languages there, i.e. the boilerplate to be shown there, once the user selects a language to code there, thus here below.

See the next steps in ProblemsPage.jsx file now there, thus here below.
