Now for deployment, the deployment platform "render.com" will look our github repository, but we have no node_modules there as by rule we never load the large node_modules file on github ; so we will be having a script, so that render.com can install our dependencies there, thus here below.

We for this know that : even if we delete the node_modules from our vs code now > then we can go in the root folder and do > npm init -y > this will give us a package.json file > now : there in that file we can add a script that : "build" : "npm install --prefix backend && npm install --prefix frontend" > this file will be seen by the render.com too and it will run the npm i commands in both fromtend and backend folder and install the dependencies of node_modules in both of them while being deployed there ; we can even check it now by doing "npm run build" in the root in the termin' there and see the dependencies being installed that we had deleted the "node_modules" folder earlier there.

Actually they read the package.json files of both and know what all packages to download and thus do it using the "npm install" command there, thus here below.

We also now here have a "React App" in frontend folder ; there we in package.json of frontend, we have a script > "build" which will take the entire react app in frontend folder and optimize it and put it under a "dist" folder ; so if we in terminal do > cd frontend > npm run build > it will thus form a "dist" folder and place it in the frontend folder there && this "dist" folder has the entire react app we have made in one folder placed and there the entire react app and javascript gets loaded in one folder index.html there by this command, to be easy to be used for deploying, so we will want render.com to do the same > so : we go in the root folder vala package.json file again and now do > in the same command of build, we do "&& npm run build --prefix frontend" i.e. run this command too under the frontend folder there ; so can test this by deleting that dist folder and go in root directory in terminal and do "npm run build" again there and see that the dist folder gets created again by doing this in the frontend folder there, thus here below.

Then in the backend folder > package.json > we have a "dev" script that which we use to run it on development here ; but now we add one more script there : "start" : "node src/server.js" , > because when the server has been deployed, we don't want it to listen fro changes and run server again automatically after evry change in code there, by logic ; thus here below.

See the next steps in step26.txt file now there, thus here below.
