Now : we will try to fix the problem fo saving the user saved in Clerk to MongoDB and STREAM now there using INNGEST.

SO : now we will be using WEBHOOKS here : WebHooks are automated messages that are sent whwn something happens ; here in our case that "something" is > when user is created in Clerk > so then Clerk will sent a webhook i.e. user.created to MongoDB and thus save it there ; and the middleman here helping in this is INNGEST.

Its a convention to put model file's names as User i.e. no plural and first letter capital, thus here below.

Now see the next steps in User.js file now there, thus here below.
