Now : to set the theme to be used by DaisyUI, we go in index.html > and set there -

<html lang="en" data-theme="theme_name_matching_daisy_ui_website_there">

, to get the theme go on daisy ui website and on top right choose the theme from there, thus here below.

And then : in index.css do -

@plugin "daisyui" {
    themes: all;
}

; so that now we can use all the daisyui themes from index.html there, thus here below.

So : can put any theme later in this index.html file there, thus here below.

See the next steps in HomePage.jsx file now there, thus here below.
